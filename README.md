## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
There are a number of humans in the company ready for retirement. The company needs to know who is elegible for retirement and, wether it would be productive to begin a mentorship program for 55 year-old employees who would like to move to part time but mentor new employees.

<ul>
<li>The mentee to retiree ratio by title are as follows:
Senior Engineer: %.72;
Senior Staff: %2.24;
Engineer: %4.38;
Staff: %2.21;
Technical Leader: %2.2;
Assistant Engineer: %5.74;
Manager: 0 </li>

<li>The mentors would have to tutor from 100+ mentees each (Senior Engineers) to 46 mentees each (Assistant Engineer), and there are no Manager mentors available.</li> 
<li>This program would be tough to maintain, especially considering the part-time nature of the mentor's new job.</li> 
<li>I would recommend a suplimentary program which would include recruiting mid-level employees from similar fields.</li>



## Summary: 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
  7
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The retirement numbers hit Development and Production the most, with Sales next on the list. All other departments are evenly hit. The percentages of potential mentors is evenly split over all departments with a ballpart of %2 of those retiring available as mentors. As mentioned above, this heavy mentor to mentee ratio would mean a substantial workload for the mentors.
